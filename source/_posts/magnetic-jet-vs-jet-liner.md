#### The traditional magnetic jets are becoming outdated and have many drawbacks.
Some drawbacks include:
1. Having to sanitize between customers which takes around 20 minutes on average
2. If not properly sanitized, then it easily leads to cross contamination
3. Germs and bacteria can be left over from previous customer and can lead to painful foot diseases
<!--more-->

However, the new technology created by [Contego Spa Designs](https://www.contegospa.com) called Jet Liners, solve problems that the magnetic jets fail to solve
1. Jet Liners are disposable, so no waiting time for next customer
2. No possibility of cross contamination
3. No possibility of germs nor bacteria transfering to future customers
